Using the exponential expansion of sin and cos, I plotted circle which I have uploaded,
moreover using the circle I was trying to make 2 spirals but since there were too many interations,
hence it was taking lot of time to produce the coordinates, hence I could not plot the spiral, I have uploaded  the .s file for spiral.
